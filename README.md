# Invoice Generator

A web application for generating invoices, built using React, provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for businesses to create and manage invoices. With its intuitive interface, users can easily input customer information, add items and services, and calculate totals with automatic tax and discount calculations. The app allows users to print invoices directly from the app, streamlining the invoicing process. It uses [jspdf-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-react) to capture the data from the invoice and covert it to pdf.
